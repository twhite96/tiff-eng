Starting a new Go project is cumbersome; you have to create multiple directories with subdirectories, different modules depending on the thing you're building, and more.

I am starting a Go project that I won't talk about here. I was looking for a way to scaffold the project with the necessary directories and barebones files so I can get into the project and start building.

## Go Blueprint

There is a developer I've come across on YouTube who does a lot of Go programming. While searching for a good scaffold, I came across his repo, [Go Blueprint](https://github.com/Melkeydev/go-blueprint) which is everything I was looking for and more. It has around 6,4000 stargazers so that can give you an idea of its usefulness.

## Off to build a thing

I've been consuming lots of Go content to get a feel for things with the [docs](https://devdocs.io) open and Neovim ready to go. I'm hoping to have this next project built by the middle of January. I am uncertain about this as I have to attend group therapy for a little while, which I don't want to do but alas.
