This is a learning and accountability blog.

This is my first post. It will be updated as time permits.

One of the things frustrating me lately is when I was just starting out, I blogged about literally everything; the industry was new to me and everyone was excited, I was excited at the possibility of pulling myself out of extreme poverty. I was younger, bright-eyed, without any cynicism.

Fast forward 10 years and a lot has changed. I won't get into the gory details but y'all know. Tech is not what it used to be, I've grown to despise most JavaScript anything, and I'm an industry vet who is disillusioned by the state of the industry and the world in general. That kind of pessimism weighs on me daily, so much so I don't write about anything I learn. It sucks.

So this is my blog post I'm sending you, I hope you read it. (Bonus points is you get that reference).
