> This is going to be a brief post; I have not gathered my thoughts on my current career situation, however that will come.

## What's Up?

Well, I've given up on pivoting to cybersecurity. I have also given up on IT/DevOps as a career. I will be talking about this
more in another post somewhere else which I'll link to, but it is what it is for me.

This means I have more time to build software when I get a chance and for fun and for my next endeavour which means
this blog is my main one for software dev for the foreseeable future.

I am glad to consolidate things and pare things down to just this blog and my next endeavour [Tiff Labs](https://tifflabs.org).

## What is Tiff Labs?

First, I've quit trying to have a career in tech proper. It's just not going to happen for someone my age during a recession
like this. I don't have a degree and am fully self-taught. This is a big strike against me returning to the workforce in tech and
if I can't do that, I will do my own thing. I have income from other sources to be able to do this so I am not too concerned about
making ends meet for now.

Tiff Labs is an umbrella of things- a YouTube channel, a blog, a smart home resource, and a homelab resource. I can make money from that once I get more content up and posted[^1].

I will also be doing more DIY repairing of devices and DIY building of things in general. I enjoy working with my hands more than working with code. I love both, don't get me wrong. However working with my hands gives me immense joy I don't find while writing software.

## What this blog will be

It will be a place for me to talk about the software I build for my other projects and hopefully a small business at some point. That's it.

Here is a project I'd like to build in Go:
