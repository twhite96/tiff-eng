I've long been one of those developers who start projects and overengineer them before they are properly started. This leads to stretching past my stretch goals and capabilities causing me to burnout on the project and never shipping.

I know I am never going to be able to do this thing as a steady career proper. As a disabled person in this country that isn't going to happen. But I can't stop doing it; I don't know what else to do that scratches my brain the way this thing does. So I've decided to just work on small little projects and libraries. If they take off, cool! I'll try to maintain them as best as I can. If not, it's practice and cool things I can show my prospective clients when I launch [Pixel & Circuit](https://pxlandcircuit.shop), which is a local to PA, hyperlocal to _me_ specifically, WordPress and custom site shop as well as taking a look at broken tech and fixing it if I can.

That's where I am at the moment.
